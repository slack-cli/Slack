### Managing Workspaces

Workspace administrators can:

* Decide who can create channels or add applications

* Restrict posting rights in #general

**Pro Tip**: You can belong to multiple workspaces — click your profile picture and choose **Add another workspace**.

## Mastering Channels and Conversations

Channels are the core of Slack’s communication model, keeping discussions structured and organized by subject, department, or project.

### Types of Channels

* **Public Channels**: Accessible to all members of the workspace (e.g., #design-team)

* **Private Channels**: Visible solely to invited participants

* **Shared Channels**: Allow collaboration between members of different organizations within one channel

### Channel Actions

* **Create**: Click `+` beside Channels > Create a channel

* **Join**: Use the channel browser or `Ctrl+K` / `Cmd+K` to locate one

* **Mute**: Enter `/mute` or navigate to settings > Mute this channel

* **Archive**: Go to settings > Additional options > Archive this channel

### Threads

Threads help keep chats tidy and context-specific:

* Reply inside a thread to maintain clarity in discussions

* Select "Also send to #channel" if you want the main channel to be notified

### Direct and Group Messaging

* DMs: Private one-to-one conversations

* Group DMs: Private chats with up to 9 users

## Voice, Video, and Screen Sharing

Slack supports both native and integrated solutions for voice and video communications.

### Native Calls

* Start a call by clicking the **phone** or **camera** icon inside a DM

* On paid plans, host group calls with up to 15 members

### Features

* Instantly share your screen

* Use the pencil icon to annotate during screen share

* Bring additional participants into ongoing calls

### Using / Commands

* `/call` – initiates a Slack-native call if available

* `/zoom` or `/meet` – launches Zoom or Google Meet sessions

### Recording via Standuply

Use `/voice` or `/video` to record a message. It will be uploaded to a private YouTube link and automatically shared in Slack.

## Optimizing Your Slack Profile and Availability

Your profile gives teammates insight into who you are, your position, and your current availability.

### Setting Up Your Profile

* Click your name > *Profile & account* > Edit Profile

* Fields available for customization:

  * Display name
  * Job title and team
  * Status message (e.g., "Working remotely", "Out of office")

### Status & Availability

**Pro Tip**: Set expiration timers so your status resets automatically after a set time.
